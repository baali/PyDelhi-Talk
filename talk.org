* Problem Statement
  Using chat as a platform to help/assist users on the site. *LIVE*
** Options
   + [[https://www.tawk.to][tawk]]
   + [[https://www.livechatinc.com/livechat-resources/online-customer-service-best-practices/][LiveChat]]
   + [[https://www.olark.com/][Olark]]
   + And as we start digging more the CRM tools starts showing up in results
** Opportunity Lost
   Phrases being used by these products:
   + "It is super easy to get started" - Tawk.to
   + "Chat in minutes. Copy. Paste. Chat." - Olark
   They make it sound so easy and also something which a product
   should be least bothered about.
** That is so _WRONG_
   If anything : "customers should be more integrated to the system"
   + Returning customers ends with random support staff having no clue about history of previous conversations.
   + We Miss out on all the chat-conversations.
     APIs/Logs are there, but...
   + In the times of *DATA IS KING* you don't want to be the one with
     leaky holes while everyone else is automating the heck out of
     everything.
